### Design:

**Q**: What data does my application process?

**A**: My application is a code editor. It processes and manipulates computer code.

**Q**: How do I visually represent that data?

**A**: I represent it via "blocks". Initially 2D with each block representing a piece of text code. This will be one to one at first. Blocks should only be able to snap together if it doesn't create a syntax error.

**Q**: How does the user interact with that data?

**A**: The user interacts with the code block by dragging and dropping them. Possibly double tapping or shaking the device. Long presses might do something too. I am initially planning for this program to facilitate coding on a small touch enabled device such as a smartphone.
